# A Simple To Do List



## Description

_Duration: 12 Hours_

The goal of the project was to create a simple, yet stylish, to-do list. The result allows the user to add tasks to their list. The required fields are a task name and a due date with an optional field for notes about each task.

The To-Do List sorts tasks by due date in order to allow the user to see what needs to be completed first. The app also provides the user with functionality to mark a task as completed and also to delete  task if it is no longer relevant.


### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Enter your task information in the input fields.
2. Click 'add task' and your task will appear on the page.
3. Tasks are sorted by due date to allow you to focus on the most immediate tasks.
4. Once you have completed a task click the 'complete task' button.
5. The color of the completed task will change from red to gray to indicate completion.
6. If a task is no longer relevant or you simply want to clear the clutter, click the 'delete' button to remove the task from your page (and from your task database).
